                University of Toronto's Department of Medicine
            </NavLink>
            . Prior to 2020 the application was almost exclusively used by the Internal Medicine program, but it was
            decided that the system should be expanded to for use by the whole department, and, along with that, came a
            redesign of the user interface.
        </p>
        <p>
            While I take <strong style={{ textDecoration: "underline" }}>no credit</strong> for the functionality of the
            application, I was responsible for the redesign, prototyping, and testing of the front-end UI, as well as
            general testing of the system functionality, and verification of data being uploaded-to and generated-by the
            application.

        <p>The app takes as input 3 CSV files:</p>

            <li>A reference table for the EPAs to be completed on the rotations listed in the rotations file.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>The residents in the first input are grouped by:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>the rotation</li>
            <li>the hospital the roation is taking place at</li>
            <li>the residents' seniority (i.e. Juniors or Seniors)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Four tables are produced:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>all of the residents, Rotation Coordinators, and EPAs matched by rotation and hospital</li>
            <li>the rotations and sites with exclusively Junior residents</li>
            <li>the rotations and sites with exclusively Senior residents</li>
            <li>the rotations and sites with both Junior and Senior residents</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            All of the uploading and data manipulation is done <em>entirely</em> within the browser, and there is no
            outbound network traffic, so the data uploaded is secure.
        </p>
        <p>
            For CSV input there is an info panel that explains what headers are required, and specifically missing
            headers are highlighted for the user upon upload. Subsequent uploads are disallowed until the correct
            headers are included. A sample table of data is included with each explanation.
        </p>
        <p>
            Upon completion of the uploads (or at any point in between), the output-tables can be exported as a CSV. The
            completed tables can then be used directly as input for pre-constructed Mail Merge documents for emailing to
            the Rotation Coordinators.
