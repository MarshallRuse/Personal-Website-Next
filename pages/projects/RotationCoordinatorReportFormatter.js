        <p>
            Each month, an individualized email is sent to several dozen Rotation Coordinators for the University of
            Toronto&apos;s Internal Medicine program. Each coordinator is responsible for a different (sub)specialty
            rotation at a different hospital, and each email contains the names, training levels, and rotation-specific
            assessment-objectives for the residents attending the rotation that month.
        </p>
        <p>
            Each email contains anywhere from one to a dozen residents for that block/rotation/hospital grouping, but
            the source data is only available as an un-grouped list of individual residents.

            change. Additionally, the use of an Excel macro was unintuitive to most users, and the actual .xlsm file was
            buried deep in our organization&apos;s shared drive. This web-app was made to provide a cleaner,
            more-accessible, more-informative, and more-intuitive interface to a tool that can now be{" "}

            All of the uploading and data manipulation is done <em>entirely</em> within the browser, and there is no
            outbound network traffic, so the data uploaded is secure.
        </p>
        <p>
            For CSV input there is an info panel that explains what headers are required, and specifically missing
            headers are highlighted for the user upon upload. Subsequent uploads are disallowed until the correct
            headers are included. A sample table of data is included with each explanation.
        </p>
        <p>
            Upon completion of the uploads (or at any point in between), the output-tables can be exported as a CSV. The
            completed tables can then be used directly as input for pre-constructed Mail Merge documents for emailing to
            the Rotation Coordinators.
